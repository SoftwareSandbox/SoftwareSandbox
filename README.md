# SoftwareSandbox

_An initiative to lower the threshold of learning after work._

> You push your last commit, do some final changes to your kanban board and leave the office to go home.  
> After your commute, you make dinner, do some chores, maybe put your kids to bed, and then you FINALLY have some free time.  
> Some colleagues at work were talking about some new techniques they've learned and you know you want to check it out a bit, but that sofa just looks so damn inviting.
> Even though your intentions are just, you give in - _just this time_ - to the calling of the couch.

Ever had that happen to you? Don't worry, you're not alone.  
With the strength of community we'll improve, together.

### The idea is quite simple
* Agree on an office space to meet after work, ideally this is **at work**. And straight after work, go there.
* Order food
* State what you hope to learn, or what you plan to do this evening. If you're just there to tag along that's fine too of course.
* Pair up at your leisure and do your thing.
* You can stop whenever you want, but when you do, share publically what you've learned or achieved this evening.

### What's in a name
A sandbox is a playground where you can safely build sand castles and what not, whatever they look like and that _can_ be destroyed after they're finished.  
So it's quite important that this evening remains a safe space to fail for everybody.


That's all there is to it. Have fun learning!
